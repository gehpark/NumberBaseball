# NumberBaseball

Number Baseball is a logic game. \
The computer will pick a number of length n composed of non-repeating single digits, \
and the objective of the game is to guess the said number.
The user's guesss of the n-digit number will be evaluated with strikes and balls.
x strikes means that the guess had x correct digits in their right places.
y balls means that the guess had y correct digits that were not in their right places.
The fewer guesses, the better the performance.

## How to play:
py Numberbaseball.py <num_digits>

>> Enter your first guess:
<enter_guess_of_length_num_digits>

repeat until you win.
